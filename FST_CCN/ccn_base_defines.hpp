// --- 4. DESCRIPTIONS ---
#define CCN_DESC_TYPE_1  "Standard CCN Bronzium alloy. Lightweight, curved plating designed to deflect blaster fire rather than absorb it."
#define CCN_DESC_TYPE_2  "Reinforced with internal tension struts, this barrier offers superior kinetic resistance."
#define CCN_DESC_TYPE_3  "A dense, organic-metallic composite that mimics the exoskeletal structure of the Collicoids themselves."
#define CCN_DESC_TYPE_4  "Rare Phrik-infused lattice structure. Extremely resistant to energy weapons and lightsabers."
#define CCN_DESC_TYPE_5  "Advanced composite material with integrated energy-dispersing layers. Offers excellent all-around protection."
